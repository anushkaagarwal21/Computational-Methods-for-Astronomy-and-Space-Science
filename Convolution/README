Smoothing through convolution

(a) Generate a 3D grid of size 64 × 64 × 64.
(b) Generate a Gaussian random field in this grid with mean 0 and sigma 1.
(c) Plot this field in 3D and with 2D slices.
(d) Generate a sphere (with its centre at the centre of the grid) on a grid of size 64^3. Starting with a radius of 1 grid unit. Make all cells inside the sphere have a value of 1 and all outside should have a value of 0.
(e) Fourier transform (FT) both the grids containing the Gaussian random field and the sphere.
(f) Multiply these two Fourier-transformed grids.
(g) Back FT the product grid and plot it.
(h) Vary the radius of the smoothing sphere from 1 grid unit to half of the grid size i.e. 32 for a grid of 64^3.
(i) Plot the field for these various smoothing scales.
(j) Plot the mean and variance of the smoothed field as a function of smoothing radii.
(k) Did you do everything correctly so far? Is there any need for normalization anywhere?
(l) What implicit assumption regarding the field has to be satisfied for this smoothing operation through convolution to work?
